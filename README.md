# Student-Information-Management-System
Python GUI Student Information Management System/Software is different from both StudentRecordManagementSystem/Software and StudentDataManagementSystem/Software. It shows current Date &amp; Time, color changeable Intro Slider and a Connect to Database button on top of It. In this we can insert student's Id, Name, Added Date (auto), Added Time (auto), DOB, Gender, Mobile No and Address. We can also perform Show All, Add New Student, Search, Delete, Update, Export Data and Exit operations on those data. All these records will store in mysql database and will show at Table Frame.
